			I am a solo developer who is passionate about animals. As a life long pet owner I have dedicated a large portion of my life
			to learning as much as possible about pet health and happiness. Unfortunately, many people do not have the time to do
			as much research or as much access to the information. That is why I have made it my goal to reach as many owners as possible
			and help them be the best they can for their pets!

		<!--2b.Border around content in project.css-->
		<p class="pBorder">
			FatCat aims to help reach as many pet owners as possible with accessible and simple ways to help your cat be as healthy as
			be. Most pet owners love their animals, but many don't understand the proper way to care for their animals. FatCat exists
			to help spread the difficult to find information and give owners access to the most up to date scientifically proven methods
			of keeping your cat healthy. If FatCat can help even one cat live a happier and healthier life, then it has done its job.
