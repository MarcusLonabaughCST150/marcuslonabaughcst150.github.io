		<h3 class="oHeader">Who am I?</h3>
		<p>
			I am a sole developer who is passionate about animal health. As a life long pet owner I have dedicated
			a large portion of my life to learning as much as possible about pet health and happiness.
			Unfortunately, many people do not have the time to do as much research or as much access to the 
			information. That is why I have made it my goal to reach as many owners as possible and help them
			be the best they can for their pets!

        <!--1. Mission Statement-->
		<h3 class="oHeader">Mission Statement</h3>
		<p>
			FatCat aims to help reach as many pet owners as possible with accessible and simple ways to
			help your cat be as healthy as be. Most pet owners love their animals, but many don't understand
			the proper way to care for their animals. FatCat exists to help spread the difficult to find
			information and give owners access to the most up to date scientifically proven methods of keeping
			your cat healthy. If FatCat can help even one cat live a happier and healthier life, then it has
			done its job.
