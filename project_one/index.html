				<p>FatCat is a weight management app for your cats! The FatCat app has a wide array of features to get your 
				cat's health on track and help it live a long and healthy life. Many factors go into your cat's health; 
				Things like size, weight, and breed determine the amount and kinds of food they should eat, how much 
				exercise they need, how often they should eat and so on. FatCat understands that each cat is different and 
				tailors its plan to your feline friend's needs!
