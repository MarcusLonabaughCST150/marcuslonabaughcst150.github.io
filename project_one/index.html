				<!--App Description-->
				<p>FatCat is a weight management app for your cats! The FatCat app has a wide array of features to get your 
				cat's health on track and help it live a long and healthy life. Many factors go into your cat's health; 
				Things like size, weight, and breed determine the amount and kinds of food they should eat, how much 
				exercise they need, how often they should eat and so on. FatCat understands that each cat is different and 
				tailors its plan to your feline friend's needs!
				</p> <p>
				With FatCat, you will work with your cat every day to help them be as healthy as they can be. FatCat will
				remind you to exercise your cat and give you tips to make the play session satisfying and effective. The
				app will also tell you how often to feed your cat, and the amount to feed it. Of course all good cats deserve
				a treat now and then, and FatCat will help you give them a safe amount in ways that will leave them satisfied.
				</p><p>
				Can't afford the app right now? No problem! We will still give you the tools you need to help your cat out. If
				you want to take it a step further, the full version is where you can find detailed information on how to
				play with your cat effectively, what brands we believe to be the healthiest and many more hand-picked tips!
