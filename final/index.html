			<p style="padding-left: 30px">
				I am a developer who is passionate about two things: food, and saving money! I have spent many hours in my life comparing
				the costs of groceries, researching ways to save money on food, ways to make cooking go faster, and ways to make food
				taste better! After spending a long time bouncing from website to website, I decided to create a website to contain all
				of the things I have learned about cooking and shopping in one place.
